**Background and Objective**

Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego, CA., specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In their most recent efforts, they've since begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. In their most recent animal study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. The objective of this assignment is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

**Conclusions**

- Capomulin by far was the most effective treatment for squamous cell carcinoma in this study. In terms of tumor volume reduction, the Capomulin-treated mice experienced on average nearly a 9 mm3 volume reduction, which corresponds to a 19% overall reduction in volume. Similarly, the growth of metastatic sites was lower than mice treated with other drugs. The survival rate of the Capomulin-treated mice was the highest amongst the other treatments, with an average of 21 mice surving from the initial sample of 25.

- The least effective treatment was Ketapril, which resulted in a 57% increase in tumor volume (25.66 mm3), the largest spread of metastatic sites (3.36), and a 44% mouse survival rate.

- Infubinol shows some promise as a treatment in that tumor reduction was slightly greater than the placebo (46% vs. 51%), and Infubinol-treated mice experienced a slower spread of metastatic sites versus Ketapril and the placebo; however, survival rates were the lowest of all groups (36%).
